## Thank You

Thank you for working through the Epicodus Intro to Programming Workshop. We hope you've had fun building a web application with us, and learned some new information about tools like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

If you'd like to continue learning, there are great resources all around the internet. We're proud of the work our staff has done on our expansive, and free curriculum at [learnhowtoprogram.com](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming/getting-started-at-epicodus-64627971-b5be-49e7-a8d7-7ca55d0c9e88/learn-how-to-program). We hope you take the time to try a few more exercises or work to expand your knowledge there.

If you've enjoyed your time in our classroom, working with our lessons we invite to apply to either our part-time or full-time courses at Epicodus. We teach classes in five different language tracks in [Seattle](https://www.epicodus.com/seattle/) and [Portland](https://www.epicodus.com/portland/), have industry leading [career services](https://www.epicodus.com/career-services/) for graduates, and are proud winners of multiple [national bootcamp awards](https://www.epicodus.com/blog/epicodus-wins-industry-awards-and-badges). Visit our website at [epicodus.com](http://www.epicodus.com/) or visit with the staff members here at the workshop to learn more.

We were proud to host you today.
