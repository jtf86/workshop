### Using CSS

**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheet**. Just as HTML defines *what* appears on our page, CSS defines how it *looks*.

Let's begin by creating a new style sheet from our Terminal.

Use `pwd` to verify that your Terminal is within the project folder, and enter the following commands:

* `mkdir css` This will create a new folder called *css* where we can store our CSS.
* `touch css/styles.css` This will create a new CSS file within the *css* directory.
